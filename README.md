# SECURE-SIGHT-AI
** Note : This project still is in development phase and consist of various models throughout the process. **

SecureSight AI is an advanced browser-based suspicious activity and break-in detection system developed using Python, CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM. It analyzes video and audio in real-time to detect abnormal behaviors, suspicious actions, and unusual sounds, providing automated alerts to enhance security monitoring.

The project showcases expertise in audio processing, and deep learning, integrating multimodal data for accurate context-based analysis. It emphasizes real-time performance, reliability, and intelligent alert generation.

Developed individually, SecureSight AI improved skills in AI model development, data fusion, and implementing efficient alerting systems, while deepening the understanding of security applications in real-world environments.
